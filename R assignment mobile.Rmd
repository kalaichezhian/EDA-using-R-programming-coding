## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
ggplot(mobile, aes(x = Selling.Price)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
ggplot(mobile, aes(x =Original.Price )) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, fill = "brown", color = "black") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r models}
ggplot(mobile, aes(x = Models, y = Original.Price)) + 
  geom_boxplot(fill = "purple", color = "pink") +
  theme_minimal()
```
```{r}
ggplot(mobile, aes(x =Selling.Price, y = Original.Price)) + 
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  theme_minimal()
```
```{r}
ggplot(mobile, aes(x = Selling.Price, y =Discount)) + 
  geom_point(color = "red") +
  theme_minimal()
```
